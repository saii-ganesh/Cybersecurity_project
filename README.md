Steganography: Hiding Text in an Image
This project demonstrates a Python-based implementation of steganography, a technique of hiding messages within other non-secret data to ensure confidentiality and security. In this repository, we provide scripts to encode text messages into image files and decode them back to their original form using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method.

Features:
Encoding: Embeds a text message into the least significant bits of image pixels.
Decoding: Retrieves hidden messages from encoded images without visibly altering the image.

Key Components:
Python Scripts: Includes scripts for encoding (encode.py) and decoding (decode.py) text messages into/from images.
Sample Images: Provides sample images for testing and demonstration purposes.
